# Architecture Decision Record: Skeleton Screens

## Context

In the work of trying to improve the performance
of the search results we needed a way to fill
the viewport with a simulated interface in order to:

* Show some content immediately to the user
* Prevent layout shifting between loading state and ready state

## Decision

We decided to implement skeleton screens when loading data.
The skeleton screens are rendered in pure css.
The css classes are coming from the library: skeleton-screen-css

## Alternatives considered

The library is very small and based on simple css rules,
so we could have consider replicating it
in our own design system or make something similar.
But by using the open source library we are ensured,
to a certain extent, that the code is being maintained,
corrected and evolves as time goes by.

We could also have chosen to use images or GIF's
to render the screens. But by using the simple toolbox
of skeleton-screen-css we should be able to make screens
for all the different use cases in the different apps.

## Consequences

It is now possible, with a limited amount of work,
to construct skeleton screens in the loading state
of the various user interfaces.
