/**
* This is where various scss files are joined together.
*
* Since we are mainly relying on styling form dpl-design-system
* we don't want to have an extended styling system in dpl-react.
* That being said there can be cases where we want to style components
* "locally". Then styling should be added to
* sass files in src/components/design-system.

// Here is a suggestion for separating areas of styling into different files:

// @import "_variables.scss";
// @import "_media.scss";
// @import "_space.scss";
// @import "_motion.scss";
// @import "_colors.scss";
