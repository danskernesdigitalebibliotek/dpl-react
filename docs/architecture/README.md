# Architecture decision records

We document decisions regarding the architecture of the project using [ADRs](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md).

We follow [the format suggested by Michael Nygaard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
containing the sections: *Title*, *Context*, *Decision* and *Consequences*.

We do not use the *Status* section. If an ADR is merged into the main branch
it is by default accepted.

We have added an *Alternatives considered* section to ensure we document
alternative solutions and the pros and cons for these.
